        <br>
        <br> I am Kenya Rodriguez and I was born in Los Angeles, California. I am the oldest of three siblings and grew up in San Bernardino CA.
      I moved briefly to Irving, Texas for two years during my 8th and 9th grade year of school. I enjoyed being in Texas because I loved my high schoo.
      My parents decided to move back to California, where I continued my high school years. I took many Advanced Placement classes. I was able to 
      learn so much from these classes while recieving credit for college. 
      <br>
      One of my favorite classes of high school, was my E- Business class in which I learned
      about how to use Word software as well as starting up my own business. I knew that the career path I wanted to pursue would be in business
      when I took my E-Business class. I learned how to create Excel spreadsheets, create professional Word documents,and make professional powerpoints.
      i was my E-Business class for about three years until my second semester of senior year. I graduated high school in June of 2020. 
      <br>
      During my last few months of high school, I got a part time job as a crew member for Mcdonald's. I learned a lot while I worked at Mcdonald's. I 
      got to experience how an actual job worked and how to manage my finances as well. I received paychecks but then went to set up my own bank account to recieve 
      direct deposit. The money that I managed from my bank account was used smartly because I learned how to manage my money. I was able to buy
      all the things I needed for my college dorm and had money left over to pay off my university bill for thee fall quarter of 2020.
      <br>
      I moved into the UC Riverside dorms in September 2020. The first few days were a bit tough to manage since i did not have a roommate nor did 
      I know where the cafeteria was. I began classes later and began to settle into college. Online classes have been a bit difficult but I have managed 
      because of my planning and organizational skills. These skills have helped me survive online classes and I have already applied for a job. 
      I am able to apply for a job and be a full time student because I applied the organizational skills I learned in the past which has helped me succeed.
      <br>
      I have also been able to pass my recent midterms and keep up with the workload that has been givin through online classes. I am able to plan my
      schedule my study times while still being able to talk to my friends. With the skills of organization, planning, attentiveness, and detail orientation
      I know I can succeed in my future jobs and oppurtunities that are ahead of me.<br>
